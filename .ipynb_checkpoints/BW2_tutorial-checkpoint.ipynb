    "This is a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html) with the purpose of making you familiar with the basic Python-based [Brightway2 LCA framework](https://brightwaylca.org/) and its various functionalities, all developed by [Chris Mutel and colleagues](https://2.docs.brightwaylca.org/credits.html#authors).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed to get you started with creating your own project, setting up your database(s) (used as background systems) and simple foreground systems, performing your first impact assessments, analysing your results, and running Monte Carlo simulations in calculation setups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Brightway2 builds on Python, a widely used programming language for scientific analysis, and can be installed easiest through the package and environment mangement system [*conda*](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/), we need to get either [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), an open source distribution for multiple languages including Python and R, or at least [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), the bootstrap version of Anaconda. The full Anaconda installation contains, among others, a terminal and an IDE (integrated development environment). And, good for us, it natively installs the setup for Jupyter Notebooks, through which we can work most effectively with Brightway2. Both Jupyter and Brightway can also be installed through [*pip*](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#new-to-python-and-jupyter), but it may be a tad trickier.\n",
    "\n",
    "For clarification: *conda* is, just like *pip*, a package and environment management system; the difference, however, is that \"*pip* installs python packages within any environment; *conda* installs any package within conda environments.\" (quote from [here](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2016/08/25/conda-myths-and-misconceptions/))\n",

    "* familiarity with any programming language - no Python-specific requirements, as most methods are quite intuitive and will be explained anyway. In case you are a bloody beginner, check [this](https://github.com/PoutineAndRosti/Brightway-Seminar-2017/blob/master/Day%201%20AM/1%20-%20Python%20and%20notebook%20basics.ipynb) out :)\n",

    "In a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) everything is live and interactive. And, perhaps more interesting, markdown elements and actual code are mixed - and you can even include images, videos, and other formats. There are [many](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-Jupyter-Notebooks), [many](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/maint-5.5/index.html) things that you can do with such notebooks, and there are also many [cool](https://blog.dominodatalab.com/lesser-known-ways-of-using-notebooks/) [tricks](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tips-tricks-shortcuts/) as well as some [extensions](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions).\n",
    "\n",
    "To get you started, you might want to press the `h`-key, which gives you an overview of keyboard shortcuts. Then, you have markdown (richt text containing) cells and code cells: if you hover over and select any cell by clicking on it (notice the blue bar on the left of the cell; turns green when you are in edit mode, i.e. having clicked into the cell box) you can turn it into either a markdown one by pressing `m` or into a code cell by pressing `y`; there are other types, too, but they are not relevant for what we want to do. Click on a cell to select it or simply use the arrow keys to navigate. If you want to run a cell, simply press `shift+enter`. And if you want to insert an empty cell above or below the current one, simply press `a` or `b`. For changing the contents of a cell, either doubleclick a markdown cell or click a code cell; pressing `enter` works, too. You can exit a cell using `Esc` and can copy, cut, and paste cells when pressing the keys `c`, `x`, and `v` when having selected a cell. As for the output of a command, note that clicking on it once makes it scroll-able, clicking on it twice results in hiding it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will notice further below that there are sometimes commands starting with `import`. These ones are needed to \"import\" the code of the respective package into the present code. For instance, by importing the Brightway2 package you enable the present notebook to use the Brightway2 functionalities. To have access to these packages, you need to download them first; otherwise you will receive an error message. You can download such packages in two ways: either in the notebook or in the terminal (make sure to be in the right virtual environment). To find out more about that I would advise you to use the search engine of your choice ;)\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the absolute basics, but they are already more than what you need here. Because you basically just need to run the presented cells.\n",

    "- $BA{^-1}f$... inventory\n",
    "- $CBA{^-1}f$... characterised inventory\n",

This works relatively smoothly, provided the Excel workbook is created correctly. In the following, we import a flawless dataset. However, if you are interested in tiny, tricky challenges regarding the Excel import, have a look [here](https://github.com/PoutineAndRosti/Brightway-Seminar-2017/blob/master/Day%201%20PM/Data%20IO.ipynb). The here used Excel file was adapted from this source, so that it works with our imported ecoinvent 3.5  database. Another way for importing an, now unknown, Excel file can be found [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/bitbucket.org/cmutel/brightway2/raw/default/notebooks/IO%20-%20importing%20an%20Excel%20file.ipynb).
